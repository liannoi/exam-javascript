# JavaScript Course

Examination project performed by me at the STEP Computer Academy. **I got 12/12
for work. Teacher: Vasilenko Igor Grigorevich**.

### Duration and purpose

Two days were allotted for this work.

The main idea of the work was the delivery of modules of different complexity
(in ascending order), so that each student could do for his level of knowledge.
There were five modules in total.
